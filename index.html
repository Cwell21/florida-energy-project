          <h2><span>FESC</span> Bringing Energy Solutions to the World.</h2>
          <p>
            The Florida Energy Systems Consortium (FESC) was created by the Florida State government to promote collaboration among the energy experts at its 12 supported universities to share energy-related expertise. The consortium assists the state in the development and implementation of an environmentally compatible, sustainable, and efficient energy strategic plan. The Consortium was charged to ‘perform research and development on innovative energy systems that lead to alternative energy strategies, improved energy efficiencies, and expanded economic development for the state‘. The legislature appropriated funding for research at five of the universities as well as support for education, outreach, and technology commercialization. The Consortium reports to and provides guidance on an as needed basis to the Florida Legislature, Executive Office of the Governor, and the Florida’s Office of Energy housed in the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overarching to the Consortium’s research strategy is an energy systems approach to identify innovation opportunities, prepare an energy workforce, and guide economic development.
            Through collaborative research and development across the State University System and the industry, the goal of the consortium is to become a world leader in energy research, education, technology, and 
            energy systems analysis. In so doing, the consortium shall:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Coordinate and initiate increased collaborative interdisciplinary energy research among the universities and the energy industry.</li>
            <li>Assist in the creation and development of a Florida-based energy technology industry through efforts that would expedite commercialization of innovative energy technologies by taking advantage of         the energy expertise within the State University System, high-technology incubators, industrial parks, and industry-driven research centers.</li>
            <li>Provide a state resource for objective energy systems analysis.</li>
            <li>Develop education and outreach programs to prepare a qualified energy workforce and informed public.</li>
          </ol>

            <p>
              The consortium has considerable energy-related expertise and competitively funded research. The Consortium’s research focuses on those energy areas most relevant to Florida. Specifically, the FESC research agenda addresses energy generation from our two most abundant renewable resources (biomass and solar), carbon-free electric power generation (nuclear power, carbon sequestration), tapping the energy available from the ocean along our long and populated coastline, reducing consumption through energy conservation, and defining more efficient load management and energy storage systems.

            <p>
              The Florida Energy System Consortium (FESC) performs scholarly research and analysis of energy systems that contributes to a sustainable energy economy for Florida. In formulating a research plan for FESC, it became obvious that while most current university research was focused on specific energy components, a research gap existed from a systems perspective. It was believed that combining expertise at the State universities would position university researchers to address energy systems in a manner not possible at a single university. Building on this observation, our stated vision is to be a world leader in energy research enabled by a systems approach.

            <p>
              FESC’s leadership team and organizational structure assure that truly leading edge research and development of critical importance to the Florida and national economies are developed, world-class students in multiple disciplines of energy are trained, and industry reaps the full benefits of the Consortium’s activities. The Leadership Team of FESC is comprised of highly experienced, highly successful innovators from the various energy related research fields, education, outreach, industrial collaboration, technology commercialization, and economic development. The FESC Director, Dr. Jennifer Curtis, is accountable for all mission activities of the Consortium and is assisted in his efforts by a Steering Committee, and Associate Directors in Industrial Collaboration & Commercialization, Education & Outreach, and Program Development.
